After listening to 
[episode 5](<http://www.mergeconflict.fm/44076-merge-conflict-5-programming-languages-gotta-collect-em-all>) of 
[Merge Conflict](<http://www.mergeconflict.fm>) podcast I was inspired to give this
book a read. I've always been interested in programming languages but I don't
necessarily want to master them. It's more of a way to see how the rest of the
world works so this book seemed perfect for me.
